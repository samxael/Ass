          <h3>Q: Does BikeShop offer express shipping?</h3>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Q: What is my frame size?</h3>
            <p>A: Use your height and inseam (in centimeters) to find the right bike size. </p>
            <p>Measure your height and inseam to find the right size. </p>
            <p>Place an object simulating a saddle (e.g. a book) between your legs and measure the distance from your foot sole to the upper edge of the object, to get your inseam.</p>
          </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Q: What do I do if my payment method is declined?</h3>
            <p>A: If your payment is declined, this may be due to your bank's daily limit for online transactions. High-value purchases like bikes often exceed these limits. In such cases, you can increase the limit through your bank's online services or by calling your bank directly.</p>
            <p>Additionally, remember that we have other payment options available that may work for you. However, please note that rate payment providers like Affirm may deny high-value purchases due to insufficient credit history.</p>
          </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Q: Can I track my order?</h3>
            <p>A: We make it easy for you to track your delivery no matter where it is. Once your order has been processed by us, you should receive an email informing you of your tracking reference.</p>
            <p>Please use that tracking reference to keep tabs on the progress of your delivery.</p>
            <p>Our international couriers deliver Monday to Friday.</p>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Q: I have just ordered and would like to change or cancel my order. Is that possible?</h3>
            <p>A: We do everything we can to process your order as quickly as possible and get it on its way. However, this also means that we cannot make any changes or cancellations after the order has been received.</p>
          </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
           <h3>Q: What warranty or guarantee do I have on the items purchased from BIKE24?</h3>
